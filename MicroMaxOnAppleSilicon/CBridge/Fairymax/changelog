/***************************************************************************/

4/6/2009 Unified source of ShaMax and Fairy-Max into single fmax.c file, and
         created this ChangeLog from the until then self-documenting source.

6/2/2009 Promotion code rewitten to not refer to default piece characters.

9/3/2009 Fixed big-endian bug in reading inifile (char with int format),
         and added some option features to make Fairy-Max useful as test
         engine for GUIs that want to implement the WB protocol extensions.

9/16/2009 Made signedness of char in AI explicit

27/12/2009 Added PV updating through the triangular-array method. Also added
           a multi-PV option to print lines within a certain sccore margin.

15/1/2010 Improved Makefile, updated docs
          Implement independent naming of white and black pieces. (So mirror-
          image pieces can use same letter.) 
          Change castling code to allow castling with any corner piece type.
          Implement 6th-rank promotion based on 'Queen' value.
          Makruk added as new variant to the fmax.ini file.

16/1/2010 Fixed bug in Shatranj result claims.
          Flip eval sign when side-to-move changes through WB color command.
          
17/1/2010 Removed Shatranj stalemate claim again, as it was never triggered.

1/11/2010 Implement counting of pieces, and extinction win condition.
          Add engine option to allow subdivision of variant fairy.
          Add FIDE vs Nutty Knights as variant fairy/FIDE-Nutters
          Allow white and black to promote to a different piece type.

2/11/2010 Implement duple-check rule.
          Add Spartan Chess as variant to fmax.ini.
          Update docs.

1/12/2010 Version 4.8Q, implementing a reverse setup command for sending
          pieceToCharTable and initial position to the GUI, sub-specification
          of variant fairy through an engine-defined option, allowing Seirawan-
          type gating moves in search. Seirawan Chess is added as new variant,
          pluss several new combinations of Chess with different armies

7/10/2011 Version 4.8R, keeping better track of which pieces are virgin in a
          setup position, and have a better distinction between use of the '4'
          move-rights code between an initial double-step jump without e.p.
          rights (as could so far only be used for Pawns, as the Spartan
          Hoplite), and castlings. As a result even royal pieces can now get
          an initial double-step other than castling, which has been used to
          implement Cambodian Chess as a sub-variant of Makruk (selected
          through a new option). Falcon Chess was added as a new variant.
