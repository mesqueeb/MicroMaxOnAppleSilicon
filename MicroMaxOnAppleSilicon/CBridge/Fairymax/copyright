    Fairy-Max 4.8 is free software, and you have permission do
    with it whatever you want, whether it is commercial or not.
    Note, however, that Fairy-Max can easily be configured through
    its fmax.ini file to play Chess variants that are legally pro-
    tected by patents, and to do so would also require permission 
    of the holders of such patents. No guarantees are given that 
    Fairy-Max does anything in particular, or that it would not 
    wreck the hardware it runs on, and running it is entirely for 
    your own risk.
